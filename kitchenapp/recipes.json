      "description": "Latvian cold beet soup is loved all over the Baltic States and many other places as well. It is a refreshing soup for a hot summer day.  There are numerous variations to this dish and this one was excellent. The color is a spectacular bright pink.  It is served with a topping of a cut up hard-boiled egg, perfect. The soup is best served the next day when the flavors have a chance to meld together. Enjoy!",
